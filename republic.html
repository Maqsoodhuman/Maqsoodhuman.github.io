            <h1><font color ="red">  "Constitution a living document, serving the Nation and strenthing its Citizens</font></h1><br>

            Once
            termed as a case of "Nero fiddling while Rome was burning" our
            constitution saw the light of the day under the numinous spark of Independence,
            gratified by the whole nation in the most ebullient manner;

            Still
            carries her head high in the name of "We the
            People of India"; undoubtedly making of this paragon was a tremendous task
            and our forefathers toiled their minds out, burning the midnight oil often to
            make this happen but we can proudly say their handworks are paid off when we
            see their work is enlivening in our hearts till today.<br></p>


            <p>India
            i.e. Bharat is today inextricably linked with its soul in a manner never before
            and in a need never before evidently because of the nature of policies by our
            iniquitous political power sitting at the throne of Delhi; Enthralled by the
            the vitality of our holy book in the minds of its aficionados even the Centre is
            amazed; Though this constitution gave the power to Centre to rule us but at the
            same limits the power of the Centre and strengthen the hands of "We the
            people" whenever there is an imminent threat on it, but taking a few steps
            back we need to understand the underlying problem which is the devotion of a man
            by the philistine myrmidons which laid the path of degradation and is helping
            in making his Highness place brazen Politics over the Nation and without a
            doubt is leading this nation into a jeopardy situation.</p>


            <p>Let  what the force come by "We the
            People" should hold fast to Constitutional methods for protecting it and
            in achieving our social and economic objectives; we need to abandon the bloody
            methods of revolution; Today the revolution which we need is to be drawn from
            our holy book and should be imbibed from the spirit of the constitution; As
            long as Constitutional doors are open we should not open the Grammar of
            Anarchy; today we need to open our horizons by participating in the social
            democracy rather than only political democracy; The fundamental blocks such as
            Equality, Liberty, Fraternity (Brotherhood), Secularism, should be nourished
            and imbued at every step in our lives</p>

            <p>The present government is 'by the people' but in contrast, they are not 'for the
            people' which is dangerous; Speaking
            rhetoric vociferously and cudgelling the protestors is a brazen act of
            their arrogance and accrued power; We need a government which reasons and speak
            to the people and listen to them out but unfortunately, the present government is
            nowhere close to this; It is incumbent upon us to answer "How long shall
            we continue to live in a fool's paradise" The filled in streets across the country is giving the answer "Not any more" and they are not
            ephemeral in nature  instead there are
            read for  a long fight until the government
            kneels.</p>

            <p>Inspiring
            our spirit from the struggle of freedom fighters and liberal minds of drafting
            committee today we are determined to defend our Holy book till the last drop of our
            blood.</p>
