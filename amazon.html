              <em>Home</em> for the 10% of world known species is on ablaze for the last few weeks; Vanishing through the dark skies every day
               shrieking us for help but as always we remain unnerved to the plight of them; Since the Beginning of the this year there has been
               72,000 cases of fire in Amazon of which nearly 10,00 surged in the last few weeks. Wildfires often occur in the dry
              season in Brazil, but this year has been worse than normal, according to National Institute of Space Research (INPE).
  In addition to this, fires have been deliberately started in efforts to illegally deforest land for cattle ranching. Amazon experience fire every year but this it has crossed the threshold point as EU satellite Copernicus released a map showing  smoke from the fires spreading all along Brazil to the east Atlantic coast; along with this Brazils National Institute of Space Research (INPE) has recorded 80% increase in fires this year which show the grim the situation in which we all are engulfed in; The flames are not just confined to Brazil but also to neighbouring countries like Peru, Colombia, Bolivia<br>

  In this grim situation we are seeing leaders like Evo Marles accepting foreign aid to tackle the situation but his counterpart Jair Bolsanaro has once again depicted something for which he is infamous for by declining the offer. Since the advent of Bolsanaro administration there has been large number of relaxation in the Environmental Policies; As promised; he is determined to tap the potential of Amazon; risking the life of thousands of species and ultimately humans; Firstly he has cut $23 million in the budget for the Environment, secondly Sacking the head of INPE over an absurd allegations that he was disclosing how rapidly Amazon deforestation is happening and attacking environmental charities by alleging them that they started the fire to draw the international criticism to him and defame his name; He is a climate change sceptic much like his ideological friend Donald Trump.<br>


  A callous attitude towards rainforest protection would lead to catastrophic conditions to our mother Earth; though the recent G7 summit took a note of the conflagration but we need much more than that to prevent this havoc; The role of Rainforest in mitigating the global warning cannot be disputed; Our goal for climate action (sustainable development goal 13) will remain an elusive dream if we remain num on the ongoing crisis<br>
