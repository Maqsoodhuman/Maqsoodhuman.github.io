            </div>
            <p style="text-align:right;">
              <p>From the inception of Constitution our country has been witnessing power tussle between the Union and the States, now again in the news because 5 non-BJP ruled states have refused to implement the CAA in their respective states calling it as an act of civil disobedience and some states went on the record to stop the process of NPR on whom West Bengal stands first, Kerala has been leading the power tussle against the Union since 2014 first for the Financial Commission recommendation on Centre Transfer of Funds and now on CAA, Kerala Chief Minister has called CAA violation of fundamental rights and said it goes against the secular nature of the Indian Constitution; the legislative assembly has even passed a resolution against CAA but if see deeper into the lines we found all of them are breaching their duty by violating the constitution because Citizenship comes under Union List on which States have no right to interfere and they have to oblige to what the Union says.</p>
<h2<b>Under what articles Union ascertain its rights:</b></h2>	
<p><em>Article 256</em> gives execute power to the Union to give directions to a sate for the purpose of implementing of a certain law, Forget about rejecting it the states doesn’t have right to make any law which violates the Centre Law</p>
<p><em>Article 257(1)</em> allows centre not only to make the laws through Parliament, but it can also tell the states how the law should be implemented.</p>
<p>Constitution doesn’t give the states an option to pick and choose laws to implement based on any argument proposed by the states.</p>
<p><em>Article 258(2)</em> mandates the state to give adequate individuals and resources required by the Centre for its duty, Centre will compensate for all looses of the respective state government.</p>
 <p>If the states doesn’t comply with the Union then Centre can issue warning under the power granted in article 356 which impose duty on Union to protest every state and ensure that every state is carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution; even after the warning if the state is not i mood to listen then Centre can invoke president rule under the powers granted in article 356.</p>
<h2><b>Gaps in the Constitution</b><h2>
<p>While it is true that our political structure is skewed in favour of the Centre, like we see Constitution provides scope for coercive measure by the Centre in case state governments do not act in accordance with the Constitution, there are no provisions that enable the states to take any coercive action against the centre if it violates the Constitution, while Passing of non binding resolution is seen as unconstitutional by many but in reality a resolution is not legislation, and is not governed by the principle of legislative competence. However state should not opt for resolutions for making political statements and opposition.</p>
<h2><b>Way Forward</b></h2>
<p>If the state governments feel that centre is acting in a manner that is unconstitutional, the remedy cannot by non-implementation of the laws, this is because non-implementation in itself is unconstitutional which they proclaim to protect. The option left to the state governments is to approach the Supreme Court, which, as per Article 131 of the Constitution, has original jurisdiction to the exclusion of other courts in cases between states and Centre or between states; therefore if a state really wants to oppose constitutionally then they can challenge the Validity of CAA, NPR and NRC(if any).</p>
<p> However the constitutional morale call upon the Union to resolve this issue through dialogue and discussion otherwise both of them would find difficulty in there day to day proceedings across the domains.</p>
<i>The Prime Minister and the Chief Ministers are one team. The Cabinet Ministers and the State Ministers are another team. The Civil Servants at the Centre and the States are yet another team. This is the only way we can successfully develop India.----Narendra Modi</i>
