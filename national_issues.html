            <h1><font color ="red">  "We the people of India" is a phrase which unites you and me in an unbreakable bond of love and aspirations.</font></h1>

		           We have journeyed a long path of 72 years of Our Independence with many ups and downs but we have never let the Rope of "We the people"; Which is something commendable and which should be celebrated<br>.

			            Today in the era of Hyper nationalism  and in the age of social media we are moving towards a nation where people are being enslaved at the minds of few elitist without knowing that they are enslaved; We have today reached a apogee of disdain by thinking  Rulers of this land as Hindus and Muslims and classifying everyone with the same prejudiced eyes of LEFT VS RIGHT with an idea where one who doesn’t agree with my ideology doesn’t belong to this nation;  This sense which is growing in the masses today is creating a society of hatred and bigotry. An idea of some hoodwinks who initiate this for their own profit but unfortunately we all follow them blindly and propagate there ideas without any self-study which is very depressing as an Informed citizen of this country.<br>

			               For us the Nation is what our freedom fighters had fought for; For us the Nation values are that which are enshrined in the Constitution of Our Country which starts with "WE THE PEOPLE OF INDIA"  which speaks of our unity in a wavering manner; Our forefathers has handed us a beautiful land which is rich in culture, diverse in religions and languages etc. But today we see Independence as something which doesn’t require any effort; An attitude which is showing an impeding effect on our Nation already. Nation building is not a one day or two day thing.<br>

				                 Celebrating, Protesting, Agitating by putting status and tweets for a day doesn’t work in the democracy what we need is a prolong collective effort which is inclusive in nature and secular at heart.

					               When we speak of Nation we should think of its people; A nation without people is like a Train without engine.<br>

					                    On this 73rd Independence day let us all take a firm oath of developing a nation whose people has a scientific temper, doesn’t see things in binary form and whose souls open there hearts and minds for criticisms and give an ear to them. And Last but not the least: A nation whose citizens doesn’t spread fake news without being self-aware of the domain.

					                    I am you and you are me should be the attitude of every one of us when it comes to Nation Building.<br><br>

					<i>Azad Hind me jeete hai Hum
					Par Qauf ae zamaane se kab niklenge hum.</i><br>

																                   <em> Jai Hind.</em>
