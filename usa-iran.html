Shadow of darkness glooms over the word after the killing of Iran’s General Qassem Soleimani by the US airstrike but as they say nothing is instantaneous in the world of Geo politics; The problem traces back to May 2018 when Mr Trump unilaterally moved out of Joint Comprehensive plan of action(JCPOA) also known as Iran nuclear deal followed by economic sanctions against Iran made the relations worse since then there was always some kind of verbal spat between the two countries and few skirmishes. But the last week saw a series of events which sparked Mr Trump to take such a big decision.
Pro-Iraqi militias attacked an US base and then in retaliation US carried out air strikes against them which led protestors to barge the US embassy in Baghdad and then on Friday we came to know the killing of General Qassem Soleimani from the pentagon.
</p>

<h2><b>Who was General Qassem Soleimani?</b></h2>

<p>He was commander of Quds Force, the external operations wing of Iran’s elite Islamic Revolutionary Group(IRGC); for a long time Soleimani was in charge of foreign operations, which included building networks and proxies across west Asia; He was highly revered in Iran and outside in pro-Iran regions, he became an iconic figure when he lead the war against ISIS through his network of militias whose help even the US took to fight ISIS; he gained so much popularity that he became a national figure above the politics</p>
	<p>The Pentagon has sparked an escalation by taking such reckless decision which is a unilateral act of provocation; the people of Iran have hit the streets and are furious to take the revenge and banners such as “Death to America” is seen across the country.</p>
<h2><b>Much at stake for Iranian Leadership:</b></h2>

	<p>While the people of Iran were already hit by the sanctions and were against the state over the rising prices and filled with anger for America; now gave them an opportunity to unite under the nationalistic umbrella and they feel they have nothing to loose as already there life is difficult; they see themselves as being persecuted and targeted by the west. </p>
	<p>Keeping this in mind now even the face of Iranian leadership i.e. Khamenei and his credibility will be under question; there is tremendous pressure on the government to take revenge against the Washington, but it will be very fool of Iran if they decide to break out from the Nuclear deal as now they are gaining support from other countries taking such a step will isolate them further; it is certain that Iran will respond but they will wait and will give a reply swiftly because neither of the two countries wants to involve in War in the current situation. If at all such a situation arises then Iran would definitely have upper hand as they wizard of asymmetric strength in the region and they have huge pile of missiles whose range cover all the bases of US in the region and they will go all out at it; but it is unlikely that Iran will start a war; it will use other tools to attack US.</p>




<h2><b>Question of Sovereignty for Iraq:</b></h2>

<p>Iraq is a crucial ally for the US in the war against terrorism in West Asia and Trump administration has no one to blame than themselves for ruining this because they pushed Iraq to a point where they has to choose between Tehran or Washington and it appears they have sidelined with their neighbour at present.</p> <p> The vote by Iraqi parliamentarians for a non binding resolution seeking to expel American troops out, showcased their anger and their thirst for vengeance. But there is some ray of hope for Washington as many Sunni and Kurds leaders didn’t attended that session because they feel presence of US is important for Iraq which is true in nature as removal of Us troops from the region can give rebirth to ISIS which will be a eminent threat to the whole world, But Mr Trump doesn’t seem to be in mood to listen and talk with his ally, infact he has threatened Iraq with sanctions for billions of dollars if they force US troops to move out, The approach used by him was diagonally opposite to what is required but he seems to be concerned about money rather than the strategic ally of long term plan; he vision seems to be either short term as can been seen while he is demanding pay back from Iraq if they want the troops to move out; he is pointing to Aim al asad airbase which was built by US spending billions of dollars or the foreign policy office is being heavily influenced by war monger lobbies and the nations like Israel and Saudi which desperately wants US to enter into a  war with Iran.</p>

<h2><b>Damage Control:</b></h2>

<p>Given the escalation created by Mr Trump now the whole onus to deescalate thing will be upon them; and right now nothing seems to going right at least on twitter where Mr Trump is highly active but in the background US needs high political will and understanding of Middle east to make things calm down; first of all they need to move out Iraq from this game and them make Iran sit on a table through backdoor channel; all this can happen only if the European countries stand up to mediate things in between even New Delhi has an opportunity to do that; Mr trump would definitely would not like to escalate things further as he will be going to elections in the coming months.</p>

<p>Countries across the globe will closely monitor the steps taken by both sides and even they doesn’t want any kind of war; Speaking of India we would be hit adversely in two ways 1. Iraq is the highest exporter of oil to India and any escalation further would raise the fuel prices. 2. Around 70 million Indians live in the Gulf region and we certainly doesn’t want their life’s to be at risk and the whole economy of the region will crunch which will affect the remittance coming from these regions.</p>
