              <h5><em>Time had elapsed</em> when we thought we can exploit the natural resources as we want; We know now that world is not a commodity rather it is a gift which should be nurtured and pass onto the future generations<br></h5>

	We are in midst of climate change which soon would be inevitable and by any means it could not be reversed, Climate change is today an unquestionably the most serious problem we are facing today; It is not an environmental problem it is also political, economically, cultural problem; From Global to the local everyone is at the brunt of climate change today. For some the problem is existential in nature as it has risked their lives especially people from island nations while for other it is distant problem that is overwhelmed by more immediate issues.<br><br>

	On Friday Sep 20 millions of people took the streets for a Global Climate Strike, unique in its form calling for a worldwide climate action, a demand for climate justice and real political solutions. From youngster to adults the demand are same with their slogans demonstrating their grieve and plight and fight for their right to have future which may not exist if we are silent. What started as "FridayforFuture" by a young inspiring fearless 15 year old teen named Greta Thunberg caught the eyes of the world and spread like ball of fire around the globe calling for similar action; The global protest was organized ahead of the Climate week designated by UN and will culminate with the report on climate change by IPCC which is due.<br><br>

	IPCC in its report in 2018 states that world members should restrict the temperature rise well under 1.5 degree Celsius to sustain the changes; anything around 2 degree will be devasting for the world. At the current state 1.5 degree Celsius limit will be crossed as early as 2040; To keep the on the word world would need to bring down its greenhouse gas to about half of its 2010 levels by 2030, and to net zero by about 2050 for this we need collaboration of private sector and governments of respective states. For instant sigh of relief came when Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announced his company wouldÂ reach a goal for carbon neutrality by 2040, a decade ahead of the Paris Agreement goal; such decisions is the need of the hour otherwise it is very evident that world is witnessing the change already like the fires of California, Heat waves across Europe, rise in sea levels, melting of glaciers in Himalayas, Arctic, and Greenland is already making life difficult for millions.<br><br>

	While most of the countries echo the need for methods to tackle climate change there is one man who opposes the reality of climate change ie none other than President of USA; pulling out of Paris accord US has become one of the biggest obstacle to form a global coalition to fight climate change; The youth has risen now demanding what they deserve, Now it is time for people of conscience to break their ties with corporations financing the injustice of climate change.<br><br>
